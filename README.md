Texts generated by AI Jesus can be found above as .txt files. 

NOTE: 3 more texts 'Blood', 'Greeks', and 'Wisdom' added as of Aug. 26th 2020. These texts are lower entropy models made to more accurately mimic the style of the Bible rather than take artisitc interpretations, as the previous models did (see below). 

### About the texts
'The Plague', 'Caesar', and 'The end of days' are all high entropy aka high randomness texts. This means that the A.I. took more artistic liberties when writing these.

With 'Blood', 'Greeks', and 'Wisdom' the A.I. took fewer liberties and sought to write closer to the style of the bible. 

These differences are readily apparent when looking at the texts. 'Blood' is somewhat more gramatically and lingusutically coherent and cohesive when compared to 'The Plague' but it lacks the same prophetic flare. 

One might notice that all these terms appear somewhere in the King James Bible. Caesar appears in the famous 'Give unto Caesar' quote and the Greeks (and even some Olympian Gods) are also mentioned many times. This A.I. has only ever read the Bible, nothing else. So it was fed these terms to write about so it would have some conceptual understanding of what they mean. By comparison it would have no concept of Abraham Lincoln.
